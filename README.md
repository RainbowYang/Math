# RainbowMath
## Profile
When I am programming the [FunctionPainter](https://github.com/RainbowYang/FunctionPainter), I find that many parts about math can be sorted out to be a new library. So, this is the reason why this library appear.

But this library will be more than it. Just as the name, RainbowMath, says, it may be a Math Library with anything I'm interested in about math, which is not for running speed at all.
